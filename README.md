## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learnt that mobile first design is based on CSS styling and not HTML.
I also learnt that responsive design should be done through CSS and not HTML, I added extra HTML code for mobile viewing which I later found out was not optimal or good practice as it lead to problems with the functionality of my JavaScript code. And will also lead to slower loading of webpages.

### Continued development

In future projects I will focus on mobile first design.
